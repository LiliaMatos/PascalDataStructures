This repository contains the code I made during the course Introduction to Data Structures(Introdução a Estruturas de Dados) at 'Fatec São Paulo'. 

The course uses the Pascal programming language and covered the following topics:
-Stacks
-Linked Lists(Simple, Double, Circular)
-Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees

Queues were mentioned during the course but we didn't have time to write any code on them. Additionally, Graphs, Heaps, and other kinds of data structure were mentioned and I plan on adding those types of data structures in the future.
